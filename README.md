Talkdesk's challenge application


Hello,
after spent few hours on this projectm here it's, the best that I could, hope it's good enaough to you guys.

I'm excited to hear you feedback.

I didn't get my application running on Heroku, instead I deployed on Digital Ocean

on this page you may teste my implementation

And I'm also provinding it using docker/docker-compose to run locally, 
to on localhost, just execute: docker-compose up
